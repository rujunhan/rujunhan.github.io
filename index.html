	<p>I'm a first-year CS Ph.D. student at University of Southern California, co-advised by Prof. Nanyun Peng 
		(<a href="https://violetpeng.github.io/group.html">Plus Lab</a>) and 
		Prof. Aram Galstyan at the Information Sciences Institute. </p>
	<p> My research objective is to create innovative tools to solve a variety of interesting and challenging 
		problems in our society. My current work focuses on leveraging deep structured models to extract event relations within 
		large amount of text data.</p>
	<p> Prior to joining USC, I worked at Federal Reserve and Commonwealth Bank of Australia as a statistical researcher 
		and a data scientist for more than three years. </p>
	<p> While working full-time, I obtained my Masters' degree in data science at NYU CDS where I had the privilege 
		to collaborate with brilliant researchers such as Kyunghyun Cho, Michael Gill and Arthur Spirling. </p>
	<p> Outside of machine learning and NLP research, I enjoy playing all kinds of sports games. I am a big fan of L.A. Lakers 
		and Houston Rockets. </p>
