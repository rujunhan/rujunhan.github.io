	<p>I am a final-year computer science Ph.D. candidate at University of Southern California. 
		I work on natural language processing and applied machine learning, advised by Prof. <a href="https://vnpeng.net/">Nanyun Peng</a> and 
		Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rJTwW0MAAAAJ&hl=en">Aram Galstyan</a> at the Information Sciences Institute. 
		My Ph.D research projects focuse on creating novel machine learning models for event-centric reasoning with applications 
		in information extraction, question answering and language generation.</p>
	
	<p> <b>I will defend my thesis in June, 2022. Post graduation, I will join AWS AI as an applied scientist to work on enterprise search.</b> 
		I am interested in fundamental NLP and machine learning research, 
		but I am particularly passionate about leveraging AI tools to solve challenging real-world problems.</p>
	
	<p> Prior to joining USC, I worked at Federal Reserve and Commonwealth Bank of Australia as a statistical researcher 
		and a data scientist for more than three years. While working full-time, I obtained my Masters' degree in data science at NYU CDS 
		where I had the privilege to work with Prof. <a href="https://kyunghyuncho.me">Kyunghyun Cho</a>. </p>
