	<p>I am a final-year computer science Ph.D. candidate (on the job market now!) at University of Southern California. I work on natural language processing and applied machine learning, advised by Prof. Nanyun Peng 
		(<a href="https://vnpeng.net/">Plus Lab</a> at UCLA) and 
		Prof. Aram Galstyan at the Information Sciences Institute. </p>
	<p> I am broadly interested in a variety of machine learning and AI research problems. My current work focuses on creating novel machine learning models for event-centric reasoning with applications in information extraction, question answering and language generation.</p>
	<p> Prior to joining USC, I worked at Federal Reserve and Commonwealth Bank of Australia as a statistical researcher 
		and a data scientist for more than three years. While working full-time, I obtained my Masters' degree in data science at NYU CDS where I had the privilege 
		to work with Prof. <a href="https://kyunghyuncho.me">Kyunghyun Cho</a>. </p>
	<p> Outside of machine learning and NLP research, I enjoy playing all kinds of sports games. </p>
