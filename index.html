	<p>I'm a final-year Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at University of Southern California, co-advised by Prof. Nanyun Peng 
		(<a href="https://vnpeng.net/">Plus Lab</a>) and 
		Prof. Aram Galstyan at the Information Sciences Institute. </p>
	<p> I am broadly interested in a variety of machine learning and NLP problems. My current work focuses on creating novel machine learning models for event-centric reasoning with applications in information extraction, question answering and lanugage generation.</p>
	<p> Prior to joining USC, I worked at Federal Reserve and Commonwealth Bank of Australia as a statistical researcher 
		and a data scientist for more than three years. </p>
	<p> While working full-time, I obtained my Masters' degree in data science at NYU CDS where I had the privilege 
		to collaborate with brilliant researchers such as Kyunghyun Cho, Michael Gill and Arthur Spirling. </p>
	<p> Outside of machine learning and NLP research, I enjoy playing all kinds of sports games. </p>
