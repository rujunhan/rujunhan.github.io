	<p>I am an applied scientist at AWS AI Lab working on open-domain search and QA. My current research focuses on model robustness 
		against domain/distribution shift. In general, I am interested in fundamental NLP and machine learning research, 
		but I am particularly passionate about leveraging AI tools to solve challenging real-world problems. </p>
	
	<p>I recently earned my computer science Ph.D. degree from University of Southern California, 
	   where I was advised by Prof. <a href="https://vnpeng.net/">Nanyun Peng</a> and 
	   Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rJTwW0MAAAAJ&hl=en">Aram Galstyan</a>.
	   My doctoral <a href="https://digitallibrary.usc.edu/asset-management/2A3BF1QKYMJLA">thesis</a> proposes novel machine learning models/datasets 
	   for event-centric reasoning with applications in information extraction, question answering and language generation.</p>
	
	<p> Prior to joining USC, I worked at Federal Reserve and Commonwealth Bank of Australia as a statistical researcher 
	    and a data scientist for more than three years. While working full-time, I obtained my Masters' degree in data science at NYU CDS 
	    where I had the privilege to work with Prof. <a href="https://kyunghyuncho.me">Kyunghyun Cho</a>. </p>
