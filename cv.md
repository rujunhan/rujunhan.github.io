### Work Experience

- **Graduate Researcher**, New York University, Aug 2017 -- Aug 2018
Conducted NLP research with  Prof. Kyunghyun Cho, Prof. Arthur Spirling and Prof. Michael Gill at NYU CDS, inventing a novel machine learning algorithm using Bayes by Back-prop (variational inference) in PyTorch to measure similarities of words and their uncertainty based on different document characteristics. Research objective is to understand the evolution of words in the context of political science and linguistics studies. The paper was published in 2018 EMNLP Conference Proceedings. 
Worked with Prof. Alyssa Wise to study the reflection writings of NYU dental students, applied various NLP and machine learning algorithms to understand the development progress of dental students and identified students who are in need of educational assistance.
Built an active Question Answering (QA) system in PyTorch:  integrating neural machine translation model and Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to create a query reformulator for active QA system.

- **Senior Associate, Data Scientist**, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, May 2017 -- Jun 2018
Built commercial lending risk models to predict default rates of clients with machine learning algorithms such as random forest, XGboost and Logistic regression. Independently developed the model pipeline in Python for both experiments and production. Model results outperformed the traditional risk prediction methods by more than 50
Built a time-series forecasting model in R and Python to predict Australian industry and geography risks using financial and macro-economic data. Results successfully tracked the Australian economic conditions and helped adjust risk estimations in the client level model.
Cleaned and analyzed Terabytes of clients' transaction and behavioral data and contributed to the team's big data engineering through Hive, MapReduce and Spark.


- **Senior Research Analyst**, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, , Mar 2015 -- Apr 2017
Built a GDP Forecast model by integrating 800 mix-frequency series, analyzed risk of economic series by conducting research on quantile regression methods and enhanced the efficiency of model estimation by implementing parallel computing on high speed cluster. 
Developed a statistical software in R for the FRBNY Nowcast project through the state-space model, Kalman Filter and EM algorithm and facilitated real-time predictions of current quarter GDP and other key economic indicators. 
Improved forecasting accuracy of the FRBNY DSGE model by implementing various optimization methods such as stochastic/coordinate gradient descent and simulated annealing in Matlab and Julia. Created a database for all forecast values in the research department and designed an online graphical user-interface for the database through javascript;
Studied the impact on national migration rate by merging more than a decade's census data with county level demographic data and analyzed causal inference using instrumental variable regression and bootstrapping.
