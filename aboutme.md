I'm a CS Ph.D. student at University of Southern California, co-advised by Prof. Nanyun Peng ([Plus Lab](https://violetpeng.github.io/group.html)) and Prof. Aram Galstyan at the Information Sciences Institute.

My research objective is to create innovative tools to solve a variety of interesting and practical problems in our society. My current work focuses on leveraging cutting-edge machine learning models to extract event relations within large amount of text data.

Prior to joining USC, I worked at Federal Reserve and Commonwealth Bank of Australia as a statistical researcher / data scientist, and obtained my Masters' degree in data science at NYU CDS where I had the privilege to collaborate with brilliant researchers such as Kyunghyun Cho, Michael Gill and Arthur Spirling.

Outside of machine learning and NLP research, I enjoy playing all kinds of sports games. I am a big fan of L.A. Lakers and Houston Rockets.
