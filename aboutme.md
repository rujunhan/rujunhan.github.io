I am a computer science Ph.D. candidate at University of Southern California. I've passed my thesis proposal, and I'm now finishing the final-year of the program. I work on natural langauge processing and applied machine learning, advised by Prof. Nanyun Peng ([Plus Lab](https://vnpeng.net/)) and Prof. Aram Galstyan at the Information Sciences Institute (_[ISI](https://www.isi.edu/people/galstyan/about)_).

I am broadly interested in a variety of machine learning and AI research problems. My current work focuses on creating novel machine learning models for event-centric reasoning with applications in information extraction, question answering and language generation.

Prior to joining USC, I worked at Federal Reserve and Commonwealth Bank of Australia as a statistical researcher / data scientist while obtaining my Masters' degree at NYU Center for Data Science (_[CDS](https://cds.nyu.edu)_) where I had the privilege to work with Prof. _[Kyunghyun Cho](https://kyunghyuncho.me)_.

Outside of machine learning and NLP research, I enjoy playing all kinds of sports games.
