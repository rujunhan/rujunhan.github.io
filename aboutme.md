I'm a CS Ph.D. student at University of Southern California, advised by Prof. Nanyun Peng ([Plus Lab](https://vnpeng.net/)) and Prof. Aram Galstyan at the Information Sciences Institute (_[ISI](https://www.isi.edu/people/galstyan/about)_).

I am broadly interested in a variety of machine learning and NLP problems. My current work focuses on leveraging cutting-edge machine learning models to extract events and understnd their relations within large amount of text data.

Prior to joining USC, I worked at Federal Reserve and Commonwealth Bank of Australia as a statistical researcher / data scientist while obtaining my Masters' degree in data science at NYU CDS where I had the privilege to collaborate with brilliant researchers such as Kyunghyun Cho, Michael Gill and Arthur Spirling.

Outside of machine learning and NLP research, I enjoy playing all kinds of sports games.
